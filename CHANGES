Changes
=======

1.1.0 (2024-03-15)
------------------

 - Release to the public domain.

1.0.1 (2023-04-21)
------------------

- Documentation has been updated to remove the --pre flag from pip usage, to
  note that fio-filter shadows fiona's original filter command, and note the
  existence of truth, not, and is functions.
- The project now runs tests with warnings turned into errors, but ignores
  pkg_resources related deprecation warnings. Those warnings are caused by
  munch, a transitive dependency via fiona, and will be eliminated by fiona
  1.9.4, coming in June 2023.

1.0a3 (2023-03-24)

  (#21).
