Changes
=======

1.0.1 (2023-04-21)
------------------

- Documentation has been updated to remove the --pre flag from pip usage, to
  note that fio-filter shadows fiona's original filter command, and note the
  existence of truth, not, and is functions.
- The project now runs tests with warnings turned into errors, but ignores
  pkg_resources related deprecation warnings. Those warnings are caused by
  munch, a transitive dependency via fiona, and will be eliminated by fiona
  1.9.4, coming in June 2023.

1.0.0 (2023-04-20)
------------------

This is the 1.0.0 release. There have been no changes since 1.0rc1.

1.0a3 (2023-03-24)
------------------

- Add shapely.ops functions (#23).
- Add builtin buffer, distance, length, simplify, and set_precision functions

1.0a2 (2023-03-01)
------------------

- Added a new builtin area function which allows projected area computation
  (#21).
- Add short options -r for raw mode and -n for no input (#18).
- The expression parser has been fixed so that functions with underscores and
